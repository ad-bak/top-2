# Node Path Intermediate HTML and CSS Sign-Up Form Challenge

## Overview

This project is a part of my journey with The Odin Project. It's a sign-up form for an imaginary food delivery service, designed to flex some of the new skills I've been absorbing over the past few lessons.

## Project Setup

The project setup involved setting up a git repository and HTML and CSS files with some simple dummy content. The design file was downloaded in full resolution to get a general idea of how to lay out the HTML document.

## Assets

The design includes a large background image, an external font for the 'logo' section, and an image-sidebar. The 'Create Account' button color is similar to tones found in the background image, specifically #596D48.

## Approach

The approach to this project was to first scaffold out the structure of the page, and then tackle the various sections one by one. The area behind the "ODIN" logo is a div that has a dark, but semi-transparent background color to enhance the readability of the text against the busy background image.

## Validation

The form validation was implemented using JavaScript. This includes checking if the fields are empty, if the email is in the correct format, if the phone number is valid, and if the passwords match. Each field was validated separately.

## Responsiveness

The design is made responsive using CSS media queries to ensure that the form is displayed correctly across different screen sizes.

## Reflection

While this challenge might not seem difficult for an experienced developer, I found it to be a great way to keep my skills sharp during my summer break. It's important to remember that every challenge, no matter how simple it may seem, offers an opportunity for learning and growth. I'm not here to boast about my skills, but rather to continuously improve and become a better developer.
