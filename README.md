# Intermediate HTML and CSS Sign-Up Form Challenge

## Overview

This project is a part of my ongoing commitment to continuous learning and skill refinement. During my summer break, I decided to take on this challenge from The Odin Project to keep my development skills sharp. It involves creating a sign-up form for an imaginary food delivery service. This project served as a great exercise to reinforce and expand upon my existing knowledge.

## Assets

The design includes a large background image, an external font for the 'logo' section, and an image-sidebar. The 'Create Account' button color is similar to tones found in the background image.

## Approach

The approach to this project was to first scaffold out the structure of the page, and then tackle the various sections one by one. The area behind the "ODIN" logo is a div that has a dark, but semi-transparent background color to enhance the readability of the text against the busy background image.

## Validation

The form validation was implemented using JavaScript. This includes checking if the fields are empty, if the email is in the correct format, if the phone number is valid, and if the passwords match. Each field was validated separately.

## Responsiveness

The design is made responsive using CSS media queries to ensure that the form is displayed correctly across different screen sizes.

## Reflection

This project served as a valuable exercise in maintaining and refining my development skills during my summer break. Regardless of the complexity of the task, each project presents its own unique opportunities for learning and growth.
